# Food Allergy Card

Make it easier to show the chefs your allergies. Features:

- 21 predefined allergies (both groups and specifics).
- Images for all the predefined allergies.
- Translated into English, German, Spanish and Norwegian (can show multiple languages at the same time, as well).
- QR code and an URL for sharing your allergies with the chefs.
- Add custom allergies (cannot add images and translations to them for now).
- Made for being shown from a mobile device.
- Possible to print the card out into physical cards (still working on this).
